# When Sharks Attack!

## Why do sharks attack?

Researchers  from the Global Shark Attack File have been gathering and compiling information on reported shark attacks worldwide from as far back as the 1800s. This dataset does not include every shark attack, just reported ones they have compiled over the years. The data includes myriad interactions that have been logged as attacks, including people attacked while spear fishing, diving, surfing or swimming/wading. The dataset doesn’t give one answer to this pretty complicated question. It shows that different species, not just the famous Great White Shark, are involved in attacks, and the largest number of incidents (4,704 of the 6,447 incidents listed in the dataset)  are considered “unprovoked.” These cases labeled “unprovoked” seemed the scariest to me because of their perceived randomness, so I decided to frame my exploration into why a shark might attack unprovoked. What I found was that many of these incidents happened because the sharks had been speared, caught in nets or defending their young. In incidents where the attacks seem random (and are listed as “unprovoked,”) incident files shed more nuance and light into what happened in each case, but some narratives can’t answer the question of why someone got bitten or attacked. 


## Ok, so how scared should I really be of getting attacked by a shark?

The dataset includes many types of shark encounters (including “sea disaster”), but I specifically wanted to look closer as just the incidents logged as either “provoked” or “unprovoked” to get a sense of whether there was a marked difference in the activities that led to an attack. I created a table that showed me there were 592 confirmed provoked attacks and 4,704 confirmed unprovoked attacks in these researchers’ files. On the surface, these numbers look really scary because there are significantly more unprovoked attacks, calling to mind my childhood fear that sharks are bloodthirsty jerks who will kill you for no reason. However, the data also includes incident files for many of these unprovoked attacks, showing varied reasons why an attack might have occured. In one fatal case, a woman was swimming with a group of sea lions and wearing a dark-colored wetsuit. The sea lions scattered in time, but she could not-- a tragic incident that shows that the shark wasn't attacking her randomly, but as part of its hunting habits.
The dataset shows that while you can’t guarantee absolute safety from shark attacks, you can improve your chances by avoiding activities like pulling a shark’s tail “to see what it would do” and letting go of your fishing rod or spear when a shark larger than you tries to pull you into the water. 

## Are different types of sharks more likely to be involved in attack encounters?

I realized that the way the dataset was set up wouldn’t be able to directly answer my question. Many sharks listed in the species folumn are logged simply as “shark” without more detail. Many victims also couldn’t tell what type of shark attacked them, so the listing is “unknown.” Just to get an idea, I chose to compare attack numbers between three types of sharks: the white shark, (seemingly the most famous for shark attacks), the hammerhead (which I chose because of my illogical childhood fear of them) and the wobbegong (just because I had never heard of it). As you’ll see in my pivot table, there are about 223 different ways to describe a white shark in this dataset, so I did my best to filter out unconfirmed or debunked entries that were mislabeled in the dataset. 
The numbers show that white sharks were responsible for 460 unprovoked attacks, while hammerheads and wobbegongs were responsible for 24 and 35 unprovoked attacks respectively. Although those numbers make it seem that white sharks are much more dangerous, I would need to do more research and read more of the hundreds of incident reports to get a more informed answer to this question. At a very high, general level, I found it helpful to read about these sharks’ habits on the researchers webpage, which pointed out to me that white sharks are “the super-predator; it is without question the most formidable of all sharks,” but that encounters don’t automatically result in an attack. However,  “the white shark is curious and it learns by experience. However the shark does not have hands and it often uses its teeth to inspect an unfamiliar object.”


## Notes on cleaning steps

When first exploring the data, I reconciled a few categories in the “Types” section, such as combining “unconfirmed” and “unverified” accounts. The spreadsheet also 2,000 hyperlinked zeroes that didn’t go to anything and were just marked such as “=HYPERLINK(S6453,U6453)”, which was making it hard for me to search for fields that had one blank value but other important values I wanted to look at. 

Once I decided I wanted to compare the provoked vs unprovoked attack data for three different types of species, I set out to clean the shark descriptions (specifically the species column). Although this spreadsheet includes hundreds of categories under “species” type, there are not hundreds of species represented because of variations in spelling, extraneous details, and different ways of including measurements.  At first, I started standardizing entries by including both feet and meter measurements to reconcile multiple categories that were counting the same type and size of shark but had typos in the description. In some cases, I removed extraneous info such as who identified the species to another column. 

However, after noticing many typos in the spellings of the shark names, I focused cleaning efforts on searching the sheet and corrected variant spellings (including several misspellings like “hamerhead” or “bonnethed,” a type of hammerhead shark) so when I later made  my pivot tables I would know that I was including all instances of that shark. I wanted to make sure I could search effectively for the three types I wanted to focus on: the white shark, the wollongong and the hammerhead. 

When I made my pivot tables, I used the filter function to look at the list of each species description to double check what I wanted to include. This helped me uncheck boxes for entries that had question marks by the species (indicating that type of shark was not confirmed to have attacked) or phrases like “witness thought it might be a…”
