# Which DC Neighborhood Has the Worst Helicopter Noise?

It seems like there are more and more helicopters flying over my Columbia Heights neighborhood than ever before. My neighbor, who has lived down the street from me for 15 years longer than I have even been in DC, agrees. The constant sound of hovering helicopters sets us on edge, especially the months during the summer when the George Floyd protests and multiple shootings in our neighborhoods meant helicopters slowly hovered over our homes for hours on end, well into the early morning. 

My neighbor thinks Columbia Heights has the noisiest helicopter traffic in DC because of police responses to crime, the flight paths of military helicopters, and our closeness to two hospitals. But which neighborhood truly has the noisiest helicopter traffic?

Others already compile crowdsourced data on what types of helicopters fly through DC, but I want to know which neighborhood has to deal with the most helicopter noise and who the biggest culprits (MPD, the White House, MedStar, etc.) are. This information would be useful for people interested in moving to a specific neighborhood, especially as more people are working from home these days. This information could also help discover whether some communities are dealing with a disproportionate amount of a certain type of flight activity (like police helicopters) that might not be warranted or can be changed by filing complaints. Better neighborhood-secific data could also help communities mobilize to submit more targeted noise complaints to the FAA or other agencies and get relief from the constant noise.

To start, I will look at sources like the [@HelicoptersofDC](https://twitter.com/helicoptersofdc?lang=en) Twitter account (crowdsourced), an air traffic bot called [@InTheSkyDC](https://twitter.com/intheskydc?lang=en) and the FAA. After years of resident complaints, the GAO [recently released a report](https://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-21-200#summary) on helicopter noise in DC, which could also have good data even though the report found that DC helicopter noise studies are “limited” and that most agencies don’t collect noise data or share it effectively between agencies. 

## Data points I will be collecting:
* Date
* Time of flyover
* Agency (police, medical, etc)
* Latitude
* Longitude
* Reported flight path starting location (this is for sources, like FlightAware, that don't report long and lat)
* Reported flight path ending location
* Neighborhoods flown through (Columbia Heights, Park View, Mount Pleasant, etc)
* Resident complaint issued? (Could be a metric for whether people thought this trip was particularly noisy)
* Any relevant news events or details about the incident
* Notes (for example, that the reported noise is coming from a hospital known to have a landing pad and heavy helicopter traffic.)

[Here's a link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/140NpmfwTxvbx75-MgrSE_mcfSumVUw0fu4Rr4CDSE2k/edit#gid=0) to what my rough draft dataset looks like. I used mostly bot data but would likely cross-check with other sources like Flight Aware, FAA, etc.)
