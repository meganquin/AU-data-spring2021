# Assignment 2
## KEY TOPIC: Where and why has the metro declined, and what disadvantages will this cause this moving forward in the future?
### INTRODUCTION:
Thanks to emergency funding, WMATA will be avoiding the cataclysmic service cuts that would have canceled weekend rail service, cut bus routes and made it harder for commuters to get to their destinations in 2021. The funding infusion is a temporary reprieve from the impacts COVID-19 has had on ridership, long-term construction, and the WMATA budget, but we wondered what the long-term impacts COVID-19 will have on the transportation system thousands of people rely on every day. 

Our project aims to determine who was impacted most by COVID-related closures and service cuts, and who might stand to lose from future cuts or service changes as WMATA works to approve its FY2021 budget.

### What hasn't been done that we hope to tackle:
- **Close of stations (Silver Line). Why are we investing in new stations when ridership is lower than ever. Also construction on Potomac Yard station (yellow line)**
  - We will look at why some lines are closing while WMATA continues to work on new stations, such as Potomac Yard, and expanding the Silver Line out to Dulles. How is WMATA setting priorities for their lines, and why are new lines taking precedence over keeping finished (and used) lines open? If there are budget issues, why is WMATA setting money aside to build new stations when ridership is lower than ever?
- **Analysis of the FY ‘22 budget based on the revised FY ‘21 budget and latest ridership data**
  - We would like to do a deep dive on the proposed FY ‘22 budget in comparison to the COVID revisions to the FY ‘21 budget. With ridership numbers up from the early pandemics and vaccine rollout, are the budget cuts too drastic? Since the budget is still in the proposal stage, our piece could serve to inform WMATA users before a comment period.
- **More detailed analysis on how route/line closures are actually affecting people long-term in the COVID era (as opposed to how WMATA budgets have affected residents in past years)**
  - We would like to explore how line closures are affecting users, especially those who rely on the trains and buses to get to work. How has WMATA responded to budget cuts in the past? Is there a correlation between lines staying open/closing and average income in the area? What alternatives transportation methods are available, and how accessible are they?
- **What is going on with WMATA’s stopgap funding to prevent cataclysmic changes and where/how is this going to show up in the FY ‘21 budget?**
  - WMATA has received emergency funding during the pandemic. Are they putting the money toward long-term projects like the Silver Line, or is it solely being dedicated to making up losses in ridership and advertising revenue? Are these funds restricted to FY’ 21 or can they be carried over to FY ‘22?
- **Who has the most to lose/who will be the most negatively impacted by these changes/issues in the services and in the budget?**
  - We would like to delve deeper into what it means for a common user of the service and the implications of the closure of stations. Also in the future, what does it mean the cuts in the budget for future operations. 2020 was the worst year in terms of ridership, because of the pandemic, what would be the impact for the cutting of funds and changes in the future budget. 
- **The social impact of the cuts.**
  - We would like to find data to explore the social impact, and by social impact, we are talking about going deeper to neighborhoods, social class and trying to understand how Washingtonians changed their transportation habits during the pandemic. What are the alternatives now.To cover this side, we suggest interviews with users or former users of the services.
