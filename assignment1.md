# Assignment 1

## Critique:

I looked at the story ["Experts say salvaging roadkill makes sense for numerous reasons"](https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2018/jan/14/experts-say-salvaging-roadkill-makes-sense-for-num/) 

### Central Insight:

On a scale of 1-5, I'd give this story a 4 in terms of how immediately obvious what the story was. The headline does mention it, but the first few grafs are where it gets into the many reasons people in Idaho and Washington collect roadkill, and data can show what types are collected but not always the reasons why the animals are salvaged. 

### Navigating the Data:

The story includes a map of Washington and Idaho. Color-coded dots show the location of where roadkill was found and what type of animal it is. You can click and drag the map and zoom in to get greater detail on the location. I would rate this map a 4, partly because the methodology appears in a box on the map and explains why it looks like so many more animals are salvaged in Idaho compared to Washington (law has been around longer and more animals are acceptable to collect legally). I would improve the map by allowing it to pop out into its own window instead of having it appear as an embedded map. (I want more screen space to explore the map!)

### Data Accuracy:

I don't have a lot of my own expertise to draw from, so don't know that I can confidently give this data a 5, but maybe the 5-point system isn't the greatest indicator because the story makes it clear that there are limitations to the data the reporter used througout the story. It mentions how the datasets are different for each state in part because the rules for collecting the roadkill, filling out the paperwork and marking the location of the roadkill are different. Idaho's data is much more detailed than Washington's. It also notes that the data relies on people following the rules and log as much information as they can, but human error will occur, especially when folks are asked to self-report on the map exactly where they found the roadkill. The story is clear that humans don't always accurately pinpoint those locations (which I identify with, since I have trouble with wayfinding myself!)
If I was the reporter doing this story, I would check with sources like:
* The state agencies collecting the data
* Wildlife conservationists or others that can give insight into animal behavior or why they end up as roadkill
* Folks who have self-reported their discovery of roadkill
The story does have these sources in it. 

### Quality
I'd give this story a 4 in overall quality. I loved that someone asked why the roadkill data existed and what it was used for, and I liked seeing the locations laid out on the map. The story mentions that these kinds of visualizations can help parks and wildlife departments prevent future roadkill, giving the map a sense of purpose beyond "hey, that's neat."

### Type and Color
I'd give these both a 3 on a 5-point scale. The map has nice color-coding except the colors for elk and moose look almost the same! For accessibility purposes, maybe a shape or another symbol could be used along with the colors. I also wish the dots were bigger since you have to zoom in/interact with the whole map to get a bigger picture-- but I guess that's the point!

### Creativity
I'd give it a 4 for overall creativity. It's an original idea! The map shows just how much roadkill is really out there-- which is a lot! The story is clear that the data doesn't tell us exactly why people collect it, but it highlights some of the known uses and the known locations where it has been found. I would have liked to hear more about what these agencies use the data for beyond permitting and tracking problem roadkill areas.


## Story pitch:
I am priviledged enough to be able to work from home during the pandemic, meaning I have not taken Metro or bus since March 2020 (except for a lone Metro ride in November.) I don't have to leave the house for work, but I do have to leave for errands and other tasks. I walk longer distances to do errands and only occasionally take Lyfts. As a person who does not have a car and loathes (and sometimes fears) driving, I finally got a Zipcar subscription because I perceive (correctly or incorrectly) that car travel may be a safer way to reduce COVID-19 exposure. 
Zipcar recently sent me a survey asking me how my travel habits have changed during the pandemic, and these questions made me wonder how we could track that on a local scale. [WMATA ridership was down throughout the pandemic](https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2020/12/03/metro-budget-cuts-faq/) but is slowly rising. 

I am wondering:
1. How have Washingtonians' local transportation habits changed since the pandemic started? (I'm not asking "are more people staying home?" or "are people traveling for vacation?" The question is more, "when people do go out for work, errands or other daily tasks, how do they get around?" 
1. And has this changed significantly since the pandemic? How so?
1. How are these folks getting around if not taking metro or bus? 
1. Even if the majority of these folks aren't riding because they work from home, What are the most popular travel alternatives for doing non-work travel?
1. What could this data mean for companies that bank on offering "safe" alternative transportation to public transportation?

We could talk to:
* WMATA
* Other regional lines like MARC and VRE
* Lime and those other dockless scooter/bike companies
* Lyft/Uber
* Zipcar and other carshare services
* Rental car companies
* People who have changed their daily travel habits 
* Local associations that gather data on community movement like walkability studies, etc

This is timely now because the COVID-19 vaccine is slowly being administered, which could eventually mean people will go back to their old transporation routines. Companies like Zipcar, Lyft, Lime, etc have counted on marketing themselves as safe transportation alternative-- and if folks are only using these alternatives because they perceive public transporation to be less safe (an assumption), what will happen once people get the vaccine? It's important or me to name that I personally haven't been taking public transportation because I precieve it to be a riskier travel method, but I could be wrong!
Maybe this would be a data nightmare since it would be hard to identify the people who are still taking the same types of transportation pre-pandemic as they are today. I also recognize data may not be able to answer all the questions I posed here.
