# Assignment 1

## Critique:

I looked at the story ["Experts say salvaging roadkill makes sense for numerous reasons"](https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2018/jan/14/experts-say-salvaging-roadkill-makes-sense-for-num/) 

### Central Insight:

On a scale of 1-5, I'd give this story a 4 in terms of how immediately obvious what the story was. The headline does mention it, but the first few grafs are where it gets into the many reasons people in Idaho and Washington collect roadkill, and data can show what types are collected but not always the reasons why the animals are salvaged. 

### Navigating the Data:

The story includes a map of Washington and Idaho. Color-coded dots show the location of where roadkill was found and what type of animal it is. You can click and drag the map and zoom in to get greater detail on the location. I would rate this map a 4, partly because the methodology appears in a box on the map and explains why it looks like so many more animals are salvaged in Idaho compared to Washington (law has been around longer and more animals are acceptable to collect legally). I would improve the map by allowing it to pop out into its own window instead of having it appear as an embedded map. (I want more screen space to explore the map!)

### Data Accuracy:

I don't have a lot of my own expertise to draw from, so don't know that I can confidently give this data a 5, but maybe the 5-point system isn't the greatest indicator because the story makes it clear that there are limitations to the data the reporter used througout the story. It mentions how the datasets are different for each state in part because the rules for collecting the roadkill, filling out the paperwork and marking the location of the roadkill are different. Idaho's data is much more detailed than Washington's. It also notes that the data relies on people following the rules and log as much information as they can, but human error will occur, especially when folks are asked to self-report on the map exactly where they found the roadkill. The story is clear that humans don't always accurately pinpoint those locations (which I identify with, since I have trouble with wayfinding myself!)
If I was the reporter doing this story, I would check with sources like:
* The state agencies collecting the data
* Wildlife conservationists or others that can give insight into animal behavior or why they end up as roadkill
* Folks who have self-reported their discovery of roadkill
The story does have these sources in it. 

### Quality
I'd give this story a 4 in overall quality. I loved that someone asked why the roadkill data existed and what it was used for, and I liked seeing the locations laid out on the map. The story mentions that these kinds of visualizations can help parks and wildlife departments prevent future roadkill, giving the map a sense of purpose beyond "hey, that's neat."

### Type and Color
I'd give these both a 3 on a 5-point scale. The map has nice color-coding except the colors for elk and moose look almost the same! For accessibility purposes, maybe a shape or another symbol could be used along with the colors. I also wish the dots were bigger since you have to zoom in/interact with the whole map to get a bigger picture-- but I guess that's the point!

### Creativity
I'd give it a 4 for overall creativity. It's an original idea! The map shows just how much roadkill is really out there-- which is a lot! The story is clear that the data doesn't tell us exactly why people collect it, but it highlights some of the known uses and the known locations where it has been found. I would have liked to hear more about what these agencies use the data for beyond permitting and tracking problem roadkill areas.
